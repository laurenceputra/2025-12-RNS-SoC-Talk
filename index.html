          <section>
            <h3>CS is About Problem Solving</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Your goal is not to learn to code</li>
              <li>It's to learn how to solve problems from an engineering and scientific perspective</li>
              <li>Computer Science is about managing complexity</li>
              <li>Break down a problem into smaller problems, and continue breaking it down until you have many small problems you can easily solve</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>

            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Why Fundamentals Matter</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Core fundamental skills vs usage level skills</li>
              <li>Frameworks and tools change constantly, but fundamentals remain</li>
              <li>Strong foundations help you adapt quickly to new technologies</li>
              <li>Deep understanding lets you debug and optimize effectively</li>
